# 01_Sources — Inputs

Place your inputs here. This layer is **read-only after placement**.

## Subfolders

### `specs/`
Design briefs from PD-Spec. Copy `DESIGN_BRIEF.md` from your PD-Spec project's `03_Outputs/` into this folder. The brief must contain `[INTENT]`, `[LOGIC_RULES]`, `[DATA_EVIDENCE]`, and `[USER_FLOW]` blocks.

### `bootstrap/`
For projects without PD-Spec research: legacy code, screenshots, raw notes, or any material that describes the current product state. The Kernel will process these with `[HYPOTHESIS]` tagging.
