## BL-001: Configurable Critical Analysis Level

**Context:** Homer's Car Detector is a core principle during PD-OS construction. For end users of PD-Build, the level of critical analysis the agent applies could be configurable — from "just build what I ask" to "challenge every decision without a DATA_SOURCE."

**Why deferred:** Requires Assisted Governance (v1.0+) to be meaningful. Without governance levels, there's no mechanism to modulate agent behavior.

**Origin:** PD-Build design session 2026-02-11.
