# 01_Contract — Input from PD-Spec

**Read-only after placement.** This layer receives the strategic decisions from PD-Spec.

## What goes here

- **Today (v0.1):** Copy `SYSTEM_MAP.md` and `INSIGHTS_GRAPH.md` from your PD-Spec project's `02_Work/`
- **Future (v0.2+):** `USER_STORIES.html` with `[US-XX]` references (once PD-Spec implements `/ship user-stories`)

## Rules

- Never modify files here after placing them
- Every definition in `02_Definitions/` must trace back to content in this layer
- If PD-Spec updates its decisions, replace the files here and re-run `/systemize`
