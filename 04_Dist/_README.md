# 04_Dist — Generated Artifacts

**Do not edit files here manually.** Artifacts are generated by drivers from the Kernel.

## Subfolders

### `staging/`
Temporary proposals pending Architect review. **Git-ignored** — not committed to the repo. Once approved, the driver moves content to `production/`.

### `production/`
Approved, versioned artifacts. **Committed to git.** When used inside a product repo, the `.cursorrules` file is also copied to the product root (where Cursor reads it).
