# 02_Definitions — Source of Truth

**Agent-managed.** Generated by `/systemize` from the contract layer. This is the headless design system core.

## Files

| File | Format | What it defines |
|---|---|---|
| `tokens.json` | W3C Design Tokens | Colors, typography, spacing, elevation — semantic values with reasoning |
| `components.yaml` | Functional specs | Component states, variants, accessibility requirements (v0.2+) |
| `patterns.md` | Composition rules | Layout rules, interaction patterns, flow constraints (v0.2+) |

## Rules

- Every token and rule must reference a PD-Spec insight (`[IG-XX]`)
- Definitions include the *why*, not just the *what* — AI agents need reasoning to produce coherent output
- If a definition can't justify itself with a data reference, it doesn't belong (Homer's Car Detector)
